-- command to run the program

$ hadoop jar /location/of/jarfile program-name /input/path /output/path

HomeWork:
---------

Java
Eclipse
Different types of WordCount examples

HDFS practice:
-------------

1. create a file named a.txt with some content.
2. list the files in hdfs root dir
3. put the a.txt from local machine to hdfs root dir.
4. display the contents of the a.txt file in hdfs.
5. create a directory in hdfs with your name. ex: dinesh or vishwa
6. create a directory in hdfs with my name. ex: jagadish
7. move the a.txt file from root to jagadish
8. copy the a.txt file from jagadish to your_name folder (dinesh or vishwa)
9. bring back the a.txt file from vishwa to local
10. check whether the changes taken place as expected

Assignments:
------------

Word Count => 
	1. some one can give you the code; ability to execute; eclipse or command-line
	2. you got requirement; ability to code
			10 near ways to do the same task;
			-> word count -> good one to start -> Hadoop2 + Inner_Classes
				-> 3 different classes, 3 different java files
				-> Generic Options
				-> ToolRunner
				-> Hadoop1 -> another way of doing; JobConf JobSubmit
				-> MRv1 => mapred package
				-> MRv2 => mapreduce package
				-> any other

Dinesh -> 50 mins, demistify in 20 mins, 5 - 10 program, demo of benefits
Keshav -> usecases for list, set, map, queue, etc; bring program, demo, restrictions/features
Vishwa -> generics, 5 - 10 program, quora, stack overflow
Harish -> hdfs commands, some new 20 commands
Prem   -> collections comparision of java vs sql-server; A union B; A intersection B; A minus B; together or exclusive feature
Bharath -> bring programs for all the ones he put on the board
