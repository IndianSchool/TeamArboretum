-----------

Tools to play:

MobaXterm => to have offline practice for linux/unix/bash commands
http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html

JDK => to develope java programs
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Java: 

JVM(java virtual machine) - JRE(java runtime environment) - JDK(java development kit)

Do you have java installed on your machine?
	=> JDK => the intent is you need to program (JRE is inside JDK)
	=> JRE => the intent is consumption (JVM is inside JRE)

	JDK => keyword is DEVELOPMENT => to develop a java program
	JRE => keyword is RUNTIME => to run a java program


JDK => RecordingStudio => `javac` command works	
JRE => CassetteTapeRecorder => `java` command works
JVM => HEAD of that (cant be there in isolation, needs JRE)

1970 => IBM produced a white paper => RDBMS => 'select blah';
data processing => write program => result

Mysql => DataBase => its a software => every software need to be written in a language
	=> c/c++ are used to develop Mysql

HIVE => .. => written based on MapReduce (a bunch of java classes)
